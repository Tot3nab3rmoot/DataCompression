# DataCompression
Implements the Huffman data compression algorithm in a pair of C++ programs, huff and puff including writing a priority queue class, to compress a text file and decompress it back to the original file size.

## Setup
1. Fork & Clone
2. In turmenal go to the folder and run the build script by type in BUILD
3. Run the RUN script by typing RUN

## What happens when you run?
The compression program will compress the text file and show the size. It will be saved as a .huff file. Then it will run the decompression program on the .huff file. This step will decompress the .huff to a .puff file. Then it will show the size of .puff compared to the original text file.
